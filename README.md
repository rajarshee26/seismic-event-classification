# Seismic Event Classification System

## Overview
This project builds an end-to-end machine learning system to automatically
classify seismic waveform data into **earthquake** and **noise** events.

The objective is not only to achieve good classification performance, but also
to understand **why** models work, **where** they fail, and **how** such a system
would operate in a real-world seismic monitoring scenario.

The project combines signal processing, classical machine learning, deep learning,
explainability, and system-level design.
